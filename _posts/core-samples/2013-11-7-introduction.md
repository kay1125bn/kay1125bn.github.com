## Who

### Who is making CSStartup?

At the moment, just me, I'm not an expert coder by any means, I am, however, a fast study.

## What

### What is CSStartup?

If you've bothered looking at the front page, you'd have read that CSStartup is a set of two web design templates I am creating. These templates will hopefully be something people will find useful and easy to use.

## Why

### Why CSStartup?

This is actually a simple question to answer, because I want to, but besides that, it's because I feel there is a decisive lack of simple, readily useable templates. Many of the more popular templates I've found are well documented sure, but not well commented with detailed step by step instructions for the beginning user. Thus, my desire to create one.
