# What is CSStartups?

## Introduction

**CSStartups** is a web design project I've taken it upon myself to create, it will, hopefully, allow for both new and experienced coders to create a website with ease. It will include two template systems, one that is simple with easy to use css and js, as well as comments throughout. The other template system will be a bit more advanced, with a mind for experienced coders, it will include more features and functions and have less obvious css and js, but will still utilize comments.

It is my hope that I will be creating something useful not only to me, but to others as well, to this aim, I will be taking feature requests, I may or may not implement the suggested features, it depends on how useful the function would prove.
